# Mesh-Simplification

This repository contains implementations of various mesh simplification algorithms.

## QEM4VR Algorithm

This directory includes the code implementation of the **QEM4VR** algorithm, based on the paper ["Designing and Evaluating a Mesh Simplification Algorithm for Virtual Reality"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3209661). 

As the authors did not release an official implementation, I have coded the algorithm. You can find the code in the [`QEM4VR`](./QEM4VR) folder.

## Intrinsic Simplification

This directory included the code implementation of the paper ["Surface Simplification using Intrinsic Error Metrics"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06410).
